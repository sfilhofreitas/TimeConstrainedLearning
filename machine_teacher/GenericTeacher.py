This module implements the Teacher class

The Teacher represents an entity with the following
interface (set of methods):
- start
- get_first_examples
- get_new_examples
- get_new_test_ids
- get_params

The Teacher is one of the three components (Teacher, Learner, Data)
of a comunication protocol. The protocol performs the interaction
between a Teacher and a Learner.

	Methods
	-----------
	start(X: InputSpace, y: Labels, time_left: float)
		Preprocess some data, if needed.
		Informs the teacher the set of examples (along with
		the correct labels for each example) it has to
		teach to a Learner

	get_first_examples(time_left: float)
		Returns the (ids of the) first examples that should
		be given to the learner

	get_new_examples(X: InputSpace) -> Labels:
		Returns a new set of (ids of) examples that should
		be given to the learner

	get_new_test_ids(test_ids,
